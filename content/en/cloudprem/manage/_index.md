## Retention policy

The retention policy specifies how long data is stored before being deleted. By default, the retention period is set to 30 days. Data is automatically removed daily by the janitor, which deletes splits (index files) older than the defined retention threshold.

To change the retention period, update the `cloudprem.index.retention` parameter in the Helm chart values file, then upgrade the Helm release and optionally restart the janitor pod to apply the changes immediately:

1. Update the retention period in the Helm chart values file with a human-readable string (for example, `15 days`, `6 months`, or `3 years`):
{{< code-block lang="yaml" filename="datadog-values.yaml">}}
cloudprem:
  index:
    retention: 6 months
{{< /code-block >}}

2. Upgrade the Helm chart release:

    ```shell
    helm upgrade <RELEASE_NAME> datadog/cloudprem \
      -n <NAMESPACE_NAME> \
      -f datadog-values.yaml
    ```

3. Restart the janitor pod (optional but recommended for immediate effect):

    ```shell
    kubectl delete pod -l app.kubernetes.io/component=janitor -n <NAMESPACE_NAME>
    ```

## Dashboards

CloudPrem provides an out-of-the-box dashboard that monitors CloudPrem's key metrics.

### Setup

These metrics are exported by [DogStatsD][1]. You can either:

- Run DogStatsD as a standalone service, or
- Run the Datadog Agent (which includes DogStatsD by default)

Configure either option with your organization's API key to export these metrics. As soon as your CloudPrem cluster is connected to Datadog, the OOTB dashboard is automatically created, and you can access it from your [Dashboards list][2].
